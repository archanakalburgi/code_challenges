Solving this problem helped me understand the order of techniques I can explore to arrive at the solution for an array problem.

# Problem statement 

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set od numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. 

# Understand 

Input: 
- array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],
- subsequence = [3,5,7]
Output: true

Input:
- array: [10,20,30,40,50]
- subsequence: [40]
Output: true

Input: 
- array = [11,11,11,11]
- subsequence: [12,13,14]
Output: false 

Input: 
- array: [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
- subsequence: [1,6,-1,-2]
Output: false

Input: 
- array: []
- subsequence: [2,4,5]
Output: Invalid case

# Match and Plan

**List**
- iterate subsequence check for the numbers of subsequence are also present in input array and are in same order
- O(n^2) solution 
- NOTE: with this plan, we cannot handle the duplicate numbers in the array of in the sequence 
	
**Linked List**
- complicates the solution 

**Sets**
- with sets we cannot:
	- handle the duplicate values 
	- maintain the order of numbers 

**Dictionaries**
- iterate through sequence 
- build a hashmap,
	- if keys are numbers of the sequence and values are the index of the number in sequence
		- will fail in handling duplicate numbers 
	- if keys are the index of the numbers in the sequence and values are the numbers themselves
		- we won't be able to check if a number in array is present in dictionary in constant time

**Techniques**

- build an array of all the possible sequence of the input array  
- check if the given subsequence is present in the array of all the possible sequence of the input array

**Pointers**
_with pointers we can compare two numbers in the array and condition their movement accordingly. Pointers can also optimize the solution by not taking extra space_

- initialize two index pointers to 0
- let one index pointer point to the numbers in sequence and the other to the numbers in array
- if array[array_index] == sequence[sequence_index], increment sequence_index to check the next number in the sequence
- increment array_index regardless 
- return true of all the numbers in the sequence are covered 

# Implement

```sh
def isValidSubsequence(array, sequence):
    arr_idx = 0
	seq_idx = 0
	
	while arr_idx < len(array) and seq_idx < len(sequence): 
		if sequence[seq_idx] == array[arr_idx]:
			seq_idx += 1
		arr_idx += 1
	
	return seq_idx == len(sequence)	
```

# Review 

lets dry run the code with the following test case:\
array = [1,2,3], sequence = [1,3]

# Evaluate 

Complexity:
- time: O(n), where n = len(array)
- space: O(1)
