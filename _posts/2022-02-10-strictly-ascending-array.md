## Problem statement

You are given an array of integers a A new array b is generated by rearranging the elements of in the following way:
- b[0] Is equal to a[0]
- b[1] is equal to the last element of a
- b[2] is equal to a(1)
- b[3] is equal to the second-last element of
- b[4] is equal to a[2]
- b[5] is equal to the third-last element of a and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array b is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Here is how the process of generating the new array b works:

## Examples 

### Example1:

For a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2] , the output should be solution(a) = true\
The new array b will look like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] , which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is true

### Example2:

For a = (1, 4, 5, 6, 3] the output should be solution(a) = false\
The new array b will look like (1, 3, 4, 6, 5] which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is false .

## Solution

```sh
def solution(a):

    def strictly_ascending(array):
        for i in range(len(array)-1):
            if array[i] >= array[i+1]:
                return False
        return True
    
    i=0
    j=len(a)-1
    array = list()
    mid = len(a)//2

    while i < mid: 
        array.extend([a[i],a[j]])
        i+=1
        j-=1

    if len(a)%2 != 0:
        array.append(a[mid])
    
    return strictly_ascending(array)
```
