description: Pattern for checking if an array is strictly ascending

## Problem statement

You are given an array of integers _a_. A new array _b_ is generated by rearranging the elements of in the following way:
- _b[0]_ is equal to _a[0]_
- _b[1]_ is equal to the last element of _a_
- _b[2]_ is equal to _a[1]_
- _b[3]_ is equal to the second-last element of _a_
- _b[4]_ is equal to _a[2]_
- _b[5]_ is equal to the third-last element of _a_ and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array _b_ is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Here is how the process of generating the new array _b_ works:

## Examples 

### Example1:

For _a_ = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2], the output should be solution(a) = _true_\
The new array _b_ will look like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is _true_

### Example2:

For _a_ = [1, 4, 5, 6, 3] the output should be solution(a) = _false_\
The new array _b_ will look like [1, 3, 4, 6, 5] which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is false .

## Solution

```sh
def solution(a):

    def strictly_ascending(array):
        for i in range(len(array)-1):
            if array[i] >= array[i+1]:
                return False
        return True
    
    i = 0
    j = len(a)-1
    array = list()
    mid = len(a)//2

    while i < mid: 
        array.extend([a[i],a[j]])
        i+=1
        j-=1

    if len(a)%2 != 0:
        array.append(a[mid])
    
    return strictly_ascending(array)
```
