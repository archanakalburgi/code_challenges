The following problem helped me understand that in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted array.

# Problem statement 

Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree(BST) and a positive integer _k_ and returns the kth largest integer contained in the BST 

Assume the following:
- there will only be integer values in the BST 
- _k_ <= number of nodes in the BST
- if tree = [5, 7, 7] second largest value of the BST will be 7 and not 5

# Understand 

Input: [15, 5, 20, 2, 5, 17, 22, 1, 3],k = 3\
Output: 17\
![](/images/input_kbst.jpg)\
Explanation: after 22 and 20, 17 is the largest values in the given BST

Input: [1], k=1\
Output: 1

Input: [1], k=2\
Output: not a valid case

Input: [2,1,3], k=3\
Output: 3

Input: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4], k=0\
Output: Not a valid case

# Match

**List**
```sh
// traverse tree 
    build node_list 
// sort nodes_list in descending order
// return node_list[k]
```
- complexity: 
	- time: O(n)+O(n log n) -> O(n log n)
	- space: O(n)

**Linked list**
- using linked list will cost us extra time to create a liked list 

**Hashmap asd Hashset**
- both the data structure are not useful for solving the problem 

**Stack and Queue**
- we are not required to look for or maintain LIFO or FIFO order

**Heap**
- Heap are very helpful to find the kth largest or kth smallest elements 
```sh
// create max heap
// pop k times 
// return kth popped item 
```
- complexity:
	- time: O(n) + O(n log n) -> O(n log n)
	- space: O(n)
- all though with heap we can obtain the kth element, it did not improve the complexity of the algorithm that we came up by using list

# Techniques

- we can traverse a tree using BFS or DFS
- DFS has preorder, postorder and inorder traversal

# Exploring the traversals
- let us consider out first example, tree = [15,5,20,2,5,17,22,1,3] and check the order of the nodes that we visit with each traversal 

**Breadth first search**
- bfs traversal of BST = [[1],[2,3],[5,5,15,17],[20,22]]

**Preorder traversal**
- preorder traversal of BST = [15,5,20,2,5,17,22,1,3] is [15,5,2,1,3,5,20,17,22]

**Postorder traversal**
- postorder traversal of BST = [15,5,20,2,5,17,22,1,3] is [1,3,2,5,5,17,22,20,15]

**Inorder traversal**
- inorder traversal of BST = [15,5,20,2,5,17,22,1,3] is [1,2,3,5,5,15,17,20,22]

- comparing all the traversals it is safe to conclude that _in-order traversal yields a sorted array_
- taking advantage of this property we can arrive at the solution arrive at the solution
- high level steps involved are
	- traverse tree in inorder fashion - build array of nodes
	- return array[len(array)-k]

```sh
// dfs - inorder recursive 
// list of nodes
// return kth element from end
```
- complexity:
	- time: O(n)
	- space: O(n)+O(n) -> O(n)

- we could traverse the tree in reverse in-order to get the list of values in descending order
- we can do so by adding left child on to the stack an then the right child
so the right child is processed before the left child

```sh
// reverse in-order -> recursion
// list of nodes 
// return kth element 
```

- complexity:
	- time: O(n)
	- space: O(n)+O(n)

# Implementation 

```sh
class BST:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def reverse_inorder(root, array, k):
	if root == None:
		return None
	node = root
	stack = [node]
	while stack:
		if node == None:
			node = stack.pop() 
			array.append(node.value) 
			node = node.left
		else:
			stack.append(node)
			node = node.right
	
def findKthLargestValueInBst(tree, k):
	if tree == None:
		return None
	nodes_list = []
	reverse_inorder(tree, nodes_list, k)
    return nodes_list[k-1]
```

# Review 

- for the input tree [15, 5, 20, 2, 5, 17, 22, 1, 3] and k = 3
    - nodes_list = [22, 20, 17, 15, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 15]

# Evaluate:

- complexity:
	- traverse tree -> time: O(n) 
	- nodes_list + call stack -> space: O(n)+O(n)
