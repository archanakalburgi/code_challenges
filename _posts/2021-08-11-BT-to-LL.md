I found this problem interesting because it combines the concept of linked list and binary tree traversal.

# Problem statement

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.

- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

# Understand

Example 1:
<div align="center">Input:</div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="300" src="/images/input1.jpg">
</p>

<div align="center">Output:</div>

Example 2:
<div align="center">Input:</div>

# Match

**Lists**
```sh
// traverse tree:  
    preorder.append(nodes)
// traverse preorder:
    build linked list
```
- we could implement this algorithm using list
- however this might not be the ideal solution since the linked list should use the same TreeNode class.
- complexity 
    - time: O(n) + O(n) ≈ O(n)
    - space: O(n) + O(n) ≈ O(n)

**Techniques**

To solve a problem related to binary tree, it is a good idea to explore the techniques as well
- two ways we could traverse a binary tree are BFS and DFS
- since the linked list must be same as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree we need to traverse the tree in a pre-order traversal 

# Plan 

- we will have to process nodes in a pre-order fashion and rewire the tree such that each node's left is pointing to null and right pointer points to the left child of the node 
- in order to traverse a tree DFS way, we have to traverse the entire branch of the tree and then the adjacent nodes 
- in order to keep track of the node to be processed next it requires last in first out approach which can be tracked using a stack  
- once the depth is reached the nodes are popped out of stack
- in oder to do so we will initialize a stack, with it's first entry being the root of the given binary tree
- for every node, 
    - if a node has a left child, make it null 
    - make the node the new right child of the previous node 

```sh
// initialize temp = tree node
// traverse tree iteratively
    node = root
    temp.left_chid = None 
    temp.right_child = node
    temp = temp.right_child
```

# Implement

```sh
def flatten(root: TreeNode) -> None:
    if root == None:
        return None
    
    temp = TreeNode()
    node_stack = [root]
    
    while node_stack : 
        node = node_stack.pop()
        temp.left = None
        temp.right = node 

        if node.right:
            node_stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            node_stack.append(node.left)
        temp = temp.right
```
