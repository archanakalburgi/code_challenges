I am **Archana Kalburgi**, a graduate student at **Stevens Institute of Technology**. I am pursuing masters in Computer science, specializing in **Machine Learning**.

I have currently invested my time in learning data structure and algorithms and how to tackle interview coding questions as I am looking for summer-2022 internship and full-time opportunities. You can find my learning related to the same in some of my blog posts and [here](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/Algorithms). Hope you find them interesting. 

Machine Learning: Fundamental and applications, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Python Programming are the courses that I have already completed and I am looking forward to take on Deep Learning, Introduction to Deep Learning and Business Applications and Web Mining courses. 

I have gained deeper insights into machine learning algorithms through course project works, which can be accessed through the following links,
- [Job change prediction](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/job_change_prediction_project)
- [Sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/sentiment_analysis_imdb)

Some of the other interesting projects that I have worked on include
- [Built MLE classifier](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/my_coursework_stevens/blob/main/CS559/ML_Assign2/Q1_MLE.ipynb)
- [Built KNN classifier](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/my_coursework_stevens/blob/main/CS559/ML_Assign2/Q2_KNN.ipynb)
- [Reduced dimension of data using principal component analysis(PCA)](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/my_coursework_stevens/blob/main/CS559/ML_Assign3/Q1_PCA.ipynb)
- [Reduced dimension of data using fisher discriminant analysis(FDA)](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/my_coursework_stevens/blob/main/CS559/ML_Assign3/Q3_FDA_pima_indians.ipynb)
- [Identified misclassified labels using perceptron](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/my_coursework_stevens/blob/main/CS559/ML_Assign3/Q4_Perceptron.ipynb)
